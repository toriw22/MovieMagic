# MovieMagic

Movie Magic is an app that gives users the capability to simultaneously search YouTube and OMDB for movie and actor information.

How to use the app:
* First, the user is required to log in to Google in order to access the YouTube capabilities. If not logged in, the user will not be authorized to view YouTube's results
* In the upper right hand corner, the user will select a radio button for "Movie Title/Keyword" or "Actor/Actress". Without selecting a radio, the user is not able to proceed.
* After selecting a radio button to signify which type of search will be conducted, the user can enter a movie title, keyword, actor, or actress, depending on which radio is selected.
* The "Movie Database Results" section will then display a list of possible matches. 
* To display specific OMDB information and YouTube results, the user must click on a result.
